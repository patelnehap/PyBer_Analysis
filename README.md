# PyBer_Analysis

##Summary
The purpose of the project was to analyze ridesharing data for PyBer in order to promote access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underprivileged neighborhoods.
Leadership wanted the team to dive deeper to review the data by city type and provide an analysis on the total weekly fares for each city type


##Results
The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

1. The Urban city type had more total drivers than total rides, which had a dramatic impact on the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The Urban drivers had the lowest average fare per ride and earned significantly less than the Rural drivers.

2. The Rural city type had the least number of total drivers giving way to having the highest average fare per driver even though the ratio of total rides to total drivers is equivalent to the Suburban city type.

The multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" further supports the PyBer Summary DataFrame by providing trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019. 

Urban cities generate the most total revenue, followed by suburban and rural locations.
The observed outcome is not surprising, given that cities are expected to generate more revenue because they have more inhabitants than suburban or rural locations.

Summary:

1. The results of the summary DataFrame could be due to Urban city types being more compact, which collects a lower average fare per ride, while Rural city types are more spread out, which would collect a higher average fare per ride. To test this theory, PyBer should work to include mileage distance data as part of the data collection process and analysis.

2. Because there are more total drivers than total rides in the Urban city types, the Urban drivers may not have enough work to support themselves. PyBer may want to consider investing advertising dollars in the Urban city types to increase the total rides or risk losing Urban drivers.

3. If PyBer were to invest into advertising dollars in the Urban city type, the next question is when would ads be the most effective? After reviewing the Total Fare by City Tpye graph, the end of February kicks off the increase in total fares and would be a good time to launch an advertising campaign, which would also strategically help the other two city types.
